The ASP.NET Session Timeout Control provides the following
* User notification that their session is about to expire (includes countdown timer)
* AJAX-enabled session update (enabling users to extend their session without leaving the page)
* Redirect to the designated timeout page upon session expiration.

The Control itself is a .NET server control with embedded javascript that provides these capabilities via a mixture of 
client and serverside properties and methods.  The control requires jQuery for interaction with the DOM, but can 
work with any desired notification mechanism such as a simple element or a modal dialog.

By default the control works with the jQuery UI Dialog and whatever jQuery UI theme you have installed - and can be 
implemented with absolutely no coding.  User notification defaults to your site's Session Timeout minus one minute.  

The control is template based and you can layout your desired notification interface within the template or it 
may exist elsewhere on the page.


For using with other notification mechanisms there are 4 key public clientside methods available on the control:

initDialog()  - used for any one-time initialization/configuration that may be required by your notification mechanism

openDialog()	- used to tell the control how to fire your notification to the user

closeDialog()	- used to tell the control how to end your notification to the user

reset()			  - called by the user to extend their session (also ends the notification, resets timers, etc)


Examples in the included project demonstrate using the control with:
jQuery UI Dialog
SimpleModal
ThickBox
