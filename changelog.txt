1.6
---
* Upgraded to jQuery 1.7 and jQuery UI 1.8.16
* Added new content page jQueryUiMultipleDialogs which demonstrates having a jQuery UI modal dialog up and visible (with content from a separate
  page) prior to the Timeout popup being shown (and redirecting).

1.5
---
* Added jQuery EasyUI demo

1.4
---
* Added TimeoutControlClientId public property to all Master pages and added MasterType declarations to all content pages
* Modified Div pages to demonstrate using the new TimeoutControlClientId property to reset the control externally from the content page
  using both MS Ajax $find And jQuery examples.
  
1.3
---
* Reworked class (again) trying to expose *only* relevant properties and methods
* Removed all references to "dialog" as control now works with any element based mechanism
* Exposed the timeout method (for situations where you need to do more than just redirect)
* Renamed the public methods for clarity.  'showDialog' now 'show';  'hideDialog' now 'hide';  'initDialog' now 'setup';
* Added ColorBox demo

1.2
---
* Reworked class to a mixture of closures + prototypes for maximum flexibility

* Demos added for SimpleModal, ThickBox, and Div (in addition to existing jQueryUI demo)
