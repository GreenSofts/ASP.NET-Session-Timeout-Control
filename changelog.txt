1.3
---
* Reworked class (again) trying to expose *only* relevant properties and methods
* Removed all references to "dialog" as control now works with any element based mechanism
* Exposed the timeout method (for situations where you need to do more than just redirect)
* Renamed the public methods for clarity.  'showDialog' now 'show';  'hideDialog' now 'hide';  'initDialog' now 'setup';
* Added ColorBox demo

1.2
---
* Reworked class to a mixture of closures + prototypes for maximum flexibility
* jQuery UI no longer required (but is the default) as the control can work with any dialog window via overriden methods
* Demos added for SimpleModal, ThickBox, and Div (in addition to existing jQueryUI demo)

1.1
---
* Default the TimeoutMinutes to HttpContext.Current.Session.Timeout
* Default the AboutToTimeoutMinutes to TimeoutMinutes - 1
